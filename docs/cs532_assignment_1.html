  <p>For this assignment, you will exercise your ability to develop new web content using HTML & CSS.

    Your goal for this assignment is to, from scratch, develop a personal website for yourself. The page should be a functioning personal website (with real content) that you can link to from your resume. This site should consist of several pages including:
    
    a landing page with a picture of yourself and short bio (note: this page should be in an HTML file called index.html, so that it loads by default)
    project and/or hobby pages describing work you have done and your interests (at least 3 pages)
    each of these pages should include some media (e.g. an image, YouTube video, etc.) 
    a contact page describing how you can be contacted
    Each page should be formatted with modern appearing styling. There should be a consistent styling used across all pages that includes a header, a navigation menu, a content pane, and footer.
    
    Your page must be styled to appear appropriately using both a desktop and mobile browser. Use  CSS @mediaLinks to an external site. queries to define appropriate styles for both platforms. Note: While you may, you do not need to create an interactive menu system for the mobile version, since this is most easily done with javascript.
    
    You may look at other websites for ideas about how to layout and style your personal page. However, you must develop all of your html and css code from scratch. This assignment is meant to be an exercise in the fundamentals of creating web content, so you may not use any content or styling frameworks such as Bootstrap. 
    
    You are highly encouraged to develop this site using local HTML & CSS files using a text editor or Web IDE such as VS Code. You should develop your site so that it at least displays properly on Google Chrome. We will use Chrome to grade your submissions.
    
    Once you have finished editing your website, host it on the free GitHub pages serviceLinks to an external site..
    
    You are to submit a zip file containing the files and directory structure for your web page. Your code should be well documented using comments and appropriately selected element ids and class names. You must also submit the link to your live web page on the GitHub pages service.
    
    Extra Credit: For 10 extra points, you can implement both a dark and light theme for your website. You can use the javascript code below to create an onclick listener for an element on your page that will add/remove the "dark" class on the body element. You can then use CSS rulesets to implement the dark theme. Note: the dark theme does not need to persist across page loads, but if you want to implement that consider using the sessionStorage javascriptLinks to an external site. object to store the page state.
    
    <!-- <script>
    document.getElementById("<id of toggle element>").onclick = function(){
     document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0].classList.toggle("dark");
    };
    </script> -->
